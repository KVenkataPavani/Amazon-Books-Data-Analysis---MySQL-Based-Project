## Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze Amazon books data using MySQL to extract valuable insights into book ratings, pricing trends, and popular categories. By cleaning and structuring the dataset in a relational database, we perform SQL queries to uncover trends in book sales, customer preferences, and market demand.  

## Data Sources  
Created a table in **MySQL** containing the following attributes:  

- **Book Data**:  
  - **bookid** – Unique identifier for each book.  
  - **bookname** – Title of the book.  
  - **author** – Name of the author.  
  - **pages** – Number of pages in the book.  
  - **language** – Language in which the book is written.  
  - **ratings** – Average rating given by readers.  
  - **price** – Cost of the book.  
  - **category** – Genre or classification of the book.  

## Skills and Tools Used  
- **SQL**: Data extraction, transformation, and analysis (joins, filtering, aggregation).  
- **Database Management**: MySQL for storing and querying structured book data.  

## Project Scope  
- Cleaned and structured book data, handling NULL values and setting appropriate defaults.  
- Identified **top-rated books** and **most-reviewed titles** using SQL queries.  
- Analyzed **pricing trends** to determine the cheapest and most expensive books.  
- Evaluated **popular book categories** based on total ratings and reviews.  
- Assessed book distribution by **page count** to understand reading preferences.  

## Results/Findings  
- **Top-Rated Books**: Identified books with the highest ratings, providing insights into customer satisfaction.  
- **Most Popular Categories**: Categories with the highest total ratings, highlighting reader interests.  
- **Pricing Trends**: Evaluated book prices to determine affordability and premium pricing strategies.  
- **Review Patterns**: Analyzed total ratings to find books with strong customer engagement.  

This project demonstrates the power of **SQL-based data analysis** in extracting business insights from Amazon books data.
